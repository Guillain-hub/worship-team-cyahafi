    "content": "Acts 16:24-26\nSurprisingly, this is my only choice that includes singing. However, this is no ordinary song service. Considering that this duet was coming from two men who were beaten, bruised, and in shackles, their worship was pure, heartfelt, and honest. This song caught heaven’s attention and when God started tapping his foot to the music, amazing things happened.\n\nWhen we are faced with trials and hardships, let’s remember that Satan may buffet our bodies but he can’t imprison our praise!"
